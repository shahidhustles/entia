  This paper presents Entia, an innovative AI-powered conversational system for database design and management that bridges the gap between natural language and structured database operations. The system leverages large language models (LLMs) to enable seamless bidirectional conversion between natural language descriptions, SQL queries, and Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. Entia implements a dual-database architecture that separates application metadata from user databases, allowing real-time operations on both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. The system features an intelligent tool-calling mechanism that provides safe execution of database operations through client-side confirmation dialogs for potentially destructive queries. By integrating OpenAI's GPT-4o model with the Vercel AI SDK, Entia achieves streaming responses and context-aware interactions that significantly reduce the technical barrier for database design and management. The platform demonstrates practical applications in educational settings, rapid prototyping, and database schema visualization through automatically generated Mermaid ER diagrams. Our evaluation shows that Entia successfully interprets complex natural language database requirements and generates syntactically correct, normalized SQL schemas while maintaining security and user control through its confirmation framework.
